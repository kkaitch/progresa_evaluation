    "## Introduction to the project\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, I used data from the [Progresa program](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oportunidades), a government social assistance program in Mexico. This program, as well as the details of its impact, are described in the paper \"[School subsidies for the poor: evaluating the Mexican Progresa poverty program](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304387803001858)\", by Paul Shultz.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to implement some of the basic econometric techniques to measure the impact of Progresa on secondary school enrollment rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Descriptive analysis: Check the dataset's characteristics and baseline information.\n",
    "2. Simple difference: Estimate the causal impact by simple difference, by tabular analysis and regression.\n",
    "3. Difference-in-difference: Re-estimate the causal effect by Difference-in-Difference, the method which is more suitable for this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The timeline of the program:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Baseline survey conducted in 1997\n",
    " * Intervention begins in 1998, \"Wave 1\" of surveys conducted in 1998\n",
    " * \"Wave 2\" of surveys conducted in 1999\n",
    " * Evaluation ends in 2000, at which point the control villages were treated. \n",
    " \n",
    "The data are actual data collected to evaluate the impact of the Progresa program.  In this file, each row corresponds to an observation taken for a given child for a given year. There are two years of data (1997 and 1998), and just under 40,000 children who are surveyed in each year. For each child-year observation, the following variables are collected:\n",

These differences are often larger for girls than boys. \n",

These pre-program differences were not significant, suggesting that the implementation of the random assignment was performed successfully. It is really important to be aware of the underlying assumption of the method we use, and the limitation of perfect random assignment."
